Project: Dungeons and Dragons Game Tracker
Group Name: Rex Fatorem
Group Members: Jared Edge (Group Leader), Cameron Vigil,  Jeremy Groce, Julian Mendoza
Github: https://github.com/CameronVigil/dnd-game-tracker


Description:
The application will be a Dungeons and Dragons companion application. Dungeons and Dragons is a role-playing table-top game that follows a story where each player is a character in the story. Designed using C++, this will be a command-line interface application, where the user inputs commands and information is returned. The application will provide reference materials and the ability to keep track of stats during gameplay. Functionality for the application will include reference to the rule book during use, the ability to store player information and gameplay information, and game statistic tracking. All of this will be done by the user inputting commands into the terminal during use.

Development Roadmap:

Milestones:

Physical diagram of intended functionalities and interplay of said functionalities in a prototype of the final product.  
Input for character skills and traits
Input for rolls 
Programming the combat cycle (ie. an infinite loop on command) to execute functionalities in needed order as combat or turns unfold.  Allows the DM to apply built-in functionalities to specific characters (ie. inventory item used and no longer in player inventory.  Character took damage, etc.)
Functionality: Status Effects (ie. poison)
Functionality: Health
Functionality: Inventory
Streamline final product for convenience 

Bonus Milestones:
Adding a UI or some form of graphics to the program to turn it from a barebones terminal program to something more fun to use during actual DnD.
